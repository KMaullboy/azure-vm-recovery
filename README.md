# Microsoft Azure VM Backup & Recovery Project

## Overview
The goals of this project are to deploy a VM, simulate a failure, restore the VM using a snapshot, configure VM monitoring, and configure basic Azure Storage with a Storage Account.

---

## Project Overview

 1. Deploy a Linux virtual machine
 2. Create a healthy snapshot  of the VM's OS disk
 3. Simulate a "disaster" by modifying the system's state
 4. Restore the VM by swapping in a new OS disk created from the snapshot
 5. Validate successful recovery via SSH
 6. Enable and view VM metrics
 7. Create a Storage Account and Blob Container
 8. Upload a file to Blob Storage
